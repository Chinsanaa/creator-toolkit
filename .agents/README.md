## When to use

- Building or restyling Earnio UI → **earnio-design** (+ [../frontend/design-system/MASTER.md](../frontend/design-system/MASTER.md))
- Optimizing React/Next.js → **vercel-react-best-practices**
- Generating marketing assets → relevant **muapi-*** skill

Product constraints and scope still come from [../instructions.md](../instructions.md) — skills do not override MVP scope.
